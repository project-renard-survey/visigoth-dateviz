Can I change the X axis to be something other than the years from

</b></p>

<p>Sorry! That's the #1 suggestion everyone makes, and I didn't get
that feature done in time for this initial release.</p>

<p><b>
Where did this content come from?
</b></p>

<p>
When the Internet Archive scans books, we scan them as images, and
then use OCR (optical character recognition) to find the text of the
words on each page.  We use this text, for example, to
<a href="https://archive.org/details/printdisabled">make books available to our
patrons that have a difficult time reading text</a>.
OCR is an imperfect
process, so most of the incorrect and odd-looking words you see in
this experiment are probably the result of OCR, and not mistakes in
the original book.

<p><b>
How did you choose the 82,000 books in the index?
</b></p>

<p>
I created a ranking system for books, based on data such as the
publisher of a book: books from academic publishers received higher
ranks than books from vanity presses. I also used data such as
citations in Wikipedia and some book sales data from Better World
Books, a used-book seller that partners with the Internet
Archive. Using these ranks, I then picked the 82,000 books in our
collections with the highest ranks. The sentences displayed in the
results are also sorted using these ranks.

<p><b>
How does this relate to Google's Ngram Viewer?
</b></p>

<p>
<a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams">Google's Ngram viewer</a> uses the publication date of the entire book
as the date used in the graph. This visualization is using dates found
in the same sentence as the things.
</p>

<p><b>
Can you talk a little about the techical aspects of this
system?
</b></p>

<p>

Sure! The year graphs for each thing, and the sentences list for each
thing/date pair, are stored in a fully denormalized database. This
means that any user interaction with the visualization only needs 1
call to the server, which needs to perform only 1 disk read to
reply. This denormalizated data takes more storage in order to be
fast. A single server ought to be able to handle 20 queries per second
from a regular disk (spinning rust), or as much as 10,000 queries per
second from SSD.

</p><p>

The database takes 45 gigabytes for 82,000 books. I expect to eventually
index around 10 million books, which scales to a predicted 6 terabyte database.

<p><b>
What are some bugs in the current version?
</b></p>

<p>
The x-axis of this visualization isn't dynamic, which leads to
an inability to see dates before 1000 AD/CE, and also very narrow
bars in the graph at all times, even for "things" which only have
sentences with a very limited range of dates.
</p>

<p>
The sentence splitter isn't very smart, and often will show 2 or 3
sentences run together. Occasionally this means that the date
isn't very relevant to the "thing" you're interested in.
</p>

<p>
Dates in the BC/BCE range of years are incorrectly parsed as if they
were AD/CE, so a search for [Julius Caesar] will have an
inaccurate graph. (Fortunately, the bug mentioned above regarding the
x-axis prevents you from seing this!)
</p>

<p>
The counts in the year graph are frequently a bit higher than the
actual number of results - some sentences were double-counted in the
year graph. In other cases, some identical sentences from multiple
editions of the same book were suppressed & lower the number of
visible sentences.
</p>

<p>
Some extremely similar sentences still appear in the results. These
are mostly caused by slight OCR-related differences.
</p>

<p>
Searches for things which do not have Wikipedia articles will always
return 0 results, by design. We hope that a future iteration of this
experiment will use a library such as Stanford NER to extract all
"things" mentioned in a book.
</p>

<p>
Mentions of decades (1920s) and centuries (1900s) are treated as a
reference to the start year, resulting in odd-looking graphs for
things which have a lot of decade and century references.
</p>

<p>
The "thing" isn't always boldfaced in the sentence, due to various
issues. Sometimes it can be difficut to figure out what's going on if
it's a synonym that is the match. For example, "Gregorian Calendar"
and "Western calendar" are considered synonyms in the Wikipedia
